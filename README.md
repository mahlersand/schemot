# schemot
A C++ metaprogramming library.

Central to programming with schemot is the SchemotPack macro, which can contain either a list of constant integral values, or a list of data types.

Schemot packs support a range of basic list processing tasks, such as appending another list or elements and taking specific slices of lists. Many more operations are of course planned.
ValuePacks support Quicksorting.

Don't try to use it with clang, it is too slow.
